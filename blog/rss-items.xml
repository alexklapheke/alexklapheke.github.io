![New COVID-19 cases in Massachusetts (14-day moving average)](covid-mass.svg)\

&lt;!-- The good news now is that, as the graph below shows, the curve seems to have peaked,[^rcode] and while it would be remiss to hazard that we&apos;re in the clear, or comment on the efficacy of this or that public health policy, I will say that I look forward to writing about my data investigations, and 
&lt;p&gt;This blog will mainly comprise overviews of the data projects I&#8217;m working on, essays on how I approach data, particularly language data, and posts about how I use various tools&#8212;not just programming languages and text editors, but also models and theorems. I hope not only to showcase what insights can be loosed from a dataset (and what illusory insights come of unsound analyses), but also serve as an aid and reference to other data scientists&#8212;not least among whom, my future self. A full portfolio of my work can be found on &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexklaphe.github.io/&quot;&gt;my homepage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I entered data science after leaving academia, but the transition wasn&#8217;t abrupt. I&#8217;d learned to code some years prior, and ran experiments as a graduate student, punctiliously collecting small data sets, modeling them in R, and encapsulating the results in manuscripts and slides. The tools I use have changed (Python largely displacing R), and the data sets are some orders of magnitude larger, but my work in graduate school laid the flagstones for a data science career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a preface to this blog, let me introduce myself: I&#8217;m a linguist turned data scientist living in the Boston area. While a lot of my work deals with natural language, I&#8217;m interested in the gamut of data and what knowledge can be gleaned from it. &lt;!-- Typifying this is the current COVID-19 crisis---Massachusetts is now in the thirteenth week of a state of emergency---during which uncertainty, epidemiological data (&quot;[The Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic_curve)&quot;) has been exalted almost to a kind of augury. --&gt; I won&#8217;t comment much on pop data science or world events, but I hope that through reasoned analysis I can provide clarity about what data I can get hold of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should not talk so much about myself if there were anybody else whom I knew as well.&lt;/p&gt;
